               <p>Welcome to my simplified clone of <a href="https://sociobytes.com/" target="_blank">Sociobytes</a>, inspired by the hard work of Aashish Chapain. I encourage you to explore the original project as well.</p>

               <p>While the majority of features are operational, it's important to note that this project is still a work in progress. Although not intended as a competitor to Sociobytes, I am committed to ongoing updates and refining the application as time permits. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome as I strive to enhance and polish the user experience.</p>
